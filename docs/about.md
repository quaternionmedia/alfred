## Origin
Alfred began as a simple, serverless video client, designed to play video content served by other machines and manipulate a list of edits in a browser, for later rendering into a finished video by a powerful backend.


## Design

Alfred is split into several components:

- `website`: The browser based tools to create and edit videos.
- `API`: The video rendering components, available as a backend service.
