# API
Sometimes, it is more convenient to interact directly with the API, bypassing the browser based client entirely. This is especially true when building a larger application. The following is a guide to interacting with the native functions and generating videos directly from a data object.

This is an advanced topic, and requires some tool to make requests to the server. The following examples are provided using `curl`, but any requests library will have comparable features.
